Namespaces
==============

Namespaces are a way of separating project-specific variables, functions and types. In
previous versions, variables tended to cause collisions: frequently used names such as x
or y could not have different values in different scripts. Namespaces allow encapsulation
to prevent these collisions. A variable named x can coexist within multiple namespaces at
any given time, without causing a collision. Generally a namespace would encapsulate
a given project, a module within a project, or a logical module that can be reused in
different projects (such as the math namespace).

.. _namespace_desc:

The Namespace
-----------------------------

A namespace consists of variables, functions and types. A user can define a namespace
using a unique name. Within the namespace, variables can be defined to make them
usable within the namespace. These are the *persistent* variables and will be stored to
file.

Before being able to use a variable, function or type, they should be defined as element
of a namespace. The definition of the variable requires a type. Persistent variables have
to be defined in advance so that the compiler knows where to look and what type they
are. See :ref:`Variables <variables>` for more details.

When using variables, functions or types in a script, the script should know what namespace the variable, function or type is in. If the namespace is undefined, it automatically
defaults to the **local namespace** which contains variables that are *not persistent*. All
variables within the local namespace should therefore be defined locally (that is, within
the script). If using an undefined variable, the compiler will throw an error.

The local namespace is also present when using a specified namespace, and always takes
precedence over the specified namespace. Any variables defined within the local namespace will shadow - that is overrule - the variable in the specified namespace. This is to
make sure that an addition of a same-named variable in the namespace will not change
the functionality of the script. By explicitly accessing the namespace, as described in
:ref:`Best Practice <namespace_best_practice>`, you can still target the shadowed variable in the specified namespace, by
using the temporary namespace specifier (**::**).

The local namespace is created at the start of a script, and deleted when the script
terminates. Therefore the variables and types stored within the local namespace are *not
persistent*.

.. _namespace_using:

Using Namespaces
-----------------------

When a script starts, it starts out with the **local namespace**. Unless defined, the local
namespace contains no variables, and only the built-in functions and types.

A script can switch namespaces at any time using the **@using** script operation. Only
one namespace will be active at any time, with the exception of the local namespace,
which is always active and its variables always shadow the active namespace.

A variable or function can be temporarily accessed from a different namespace using the
namespace specifier. A variable can be accessed using **namespace::variable**, a function
using **namespace::function()**, and a type using **namespace::Type**.

Note that when executing a function, the functionâ€™s namespace will be used. Variables
can still be supplied from a different namespace through the parameters, and the function
can still access other variables using the **@using** operator and temporary namespace
specifier.

.. _namespace_best_practice:

Best Practice
--------------------

When using multiple variables, functions and/or types from one namespace, it is best to
use **@using**.

Sometimes it is required to use multiple namespaces at the same time, such as using a
variable from one namespace in a function of a different namespace. In this case you can
use **@using** for the most frequently used namespace, to limit unnecessary words and
characters.

When using a namespace once, it is best to use the temporary namespace specifier (**::**)
since adding additional lines would be less clear than adding the specifier.

It can occur that a variable with the same name is both defined in the namespace that
is currently set as **@using**, and in the local namespace (that is, earlier in the script). To
access the local variable, there is no need to (and you cannot) use a namespace specifier
to access the variable. To access the namespace variable, you are required to use the
temporary namespace specifier (**::**) to access the variable, because the local namespace
shadows the variable within the specified namespace, unless explicitly using the variable
from the namespace.

In general, it is best to use the most readable approach. **@using** is intended for repeated
usage, while **::** is intended for one-time-use of namespaces.
