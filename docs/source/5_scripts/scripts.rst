Scripts
========================

A script is an ordered list of script operations. A script will execute each script
operation in succession to accomplish a certain objective. Within a script commands can be
executed, variables manipulated, game state manipulated, script flow can be controlled
and more. Scripts differ from functions in that they are triggered in specific situations,
while a function has to be called explicitly, from a script, command block or through a
command.
